This, in particular, includes: calibration of various asset pricing models (local volatility, stochastic volatility, jumps) to market data; development of new approaches in constructing efficient finite difference and radial basis function methods; study of models and machine learning techniques, like Bayesian and neural networks, for asset liability management and limit order books; analysis of bond quote inconsistencies; and also implementation issues on GPU of a Monte Carlo insurance balance sheet projection.},
